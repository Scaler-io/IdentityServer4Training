# IdentityServer4 Training

## Overview

Welcome to the IdentityServer4 Training repository! This repository contains a demo application showcasing the usage and configuration of IdentityServer4, an open-source authentication and authorization framework for .NET Core.

## Introduction

IdentityServer4 is a powerful tool that enables developers to implement single sign-on (SSO) and access control in their applications. It follows the OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 protocols, making it a robust and secure solution for managing user identities and protecting APIs.

## Demo Application

The demo application included in this repository demonstrates the key features and functionalities of IdentityServer4. It is a simple yet comprehensive example that covers:

- Setting up IdentityServer4 with various authentication options
- Configuring client applications to authenticate through IdentityServer4
- Managing user identities and permissions
- Securing APIs using access tokens
- Handling token validation and revocation
